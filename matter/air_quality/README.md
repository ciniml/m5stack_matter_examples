# Matter Sensors

This example demonstrates the integration of temperature and humidity sensors (SHTC3)
and an occupancy sensor (PIR). 

This application creates the temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and occupancy sensor
on endpoint 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/developing.html)
for more information about building and flashing the firmware.

## Connecting the sensors

- Connecting the SHTC3, temperature and humidity sensor

| ESP32-C3 Pin | SHTC3 Pin |
|--------------|-----------|
| GND          | GND       |
| 3V3          | VCC       |
| GPIO 4       | SDA       |
| GPIO 5       | SCL       |

- Connecting the PIR sensor

| ESP32-C3 Pin | PIR Pin |
|--------------|---------|
| GND          | GND     |
| 3V3          | VCC     |
| GPIO 7       | Output  |

**_NOTE:_**:
- Above mentioned wiring connection is configured by default in the example.
- Ensure that the GPIO pins used for the sensors are correctly configured through menuconfig.
- Modify the configuration parameters as needed for your specific hardware setup.

## Usage

- Commission the app using Matter controller and read the attributes.

Below, we are using chip-tool to commission and subscribe the sensor attributes.
